<h2>The SNAP API Source Code Examples</h2>

The examples are available in the <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples">snap-examples repository on GitHub</a>.
Provided here is a short documentation for the Java source code examples provided along with
the SNAP Software. The examples show the basic concepts how to use the SNAP Java API
for your own applications or how to extend SNAP by writing new modules.

<p>Very simple examples showing how to read data from a product and write them out:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/data_export/BandWriterMain.java">BandWriterMain.java</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/data_export/BitmaskWriterMain.java">BitmaskWriterMain.java</a>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/data_export/TiePointGridWriterMain.java">TiePointGridWriterMain.java</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A very simple NDVI (normalized differential vegetation index) processing implementation. The package contains a single source file:
<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/blob/master/snap-engine-examples/src/main/java/org/acme/snap/examples/ndvi_simple/NdviSimpleMain.java">NdviSimpleMain.java</a>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A more advanced processor which uses parts of the SNAP Graph Processing Framework (GPF) can be found in the GitHub examples at
    <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/tree/master/snap-engine-java-operator">snap-engine-java-operator</a>.
    This example is desgned to be build as SNAP module to be separately added to an existing SNAP installation.
</p>

<p>SNAP can also understand Python code. If you like to implement a processor in Python this example is for you:
    <a href="https://github.com/senbox-org/snap-examples/tree/master/snap-engine-python-operator">snap-engine-python-operator</a>
</p>

<p>Newcomers who want to develop export tools and/or data processors are invited to look at the
    <a href="https://senbox.atlassian.net/wiki/display/SNAP/Developer+Guide">Developer Guide</a> which we have prepared in our wiki.
</p>

<p>This is the list of the most important API packages used by the examples:
<ol>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.datamodel}</code> package.</li>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.dataio}</code> package.</li>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.core.gpf}</code> package.</li>
    <li>The <code>{@link org.esa.snap.util}</code> package.</li>
</ol>
